Introduction

This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for face detection using a high-performance Faster R-CNN framework with a ResNet-101-FPN backbone. Built on top of Detectron2 and PyTorch, it highlights key stages from data preparation and model training to inference and result analysis, all within a reproducible Google Colab environment.

Motivation

Accurate face detection is foundational for numerous applications such as surveillance, humanâ€“computer interaction, and biometric authentication. While many modern solutions exist, customizing a robust detector on a specialized dataset helps:

Explore model tuning for specific conditions (lighting, occlusion, angles)
Understand trade-offs between speed and precision
Build a foundation for downstream tasks like face recognition or emotion analysis
