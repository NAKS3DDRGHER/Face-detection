# Face-detection

This repository contains two projects demonstrating different approaches to face detection.

## Projects

### 1. Face Localization with TensorFlow
A project that uses pure **TensorFlow** to locate faces in an image. This part of the repository was used to test various models and contains the core logic for displaying image outputs with **Matplotlib**.

- **Technology:** Python, TensorFlow, Matplotlib

### 2. TensorFlow Face Detection
A more advanced project utilizing the **TensorFlow Object Detection API** to build a robust face detection model. **OpenCV** is used for image processing tasks. This approach offers higher accuracy and flexibility.

- **Technology:** Python, TensorFlow, TensorFlow Object Detection API, OpenCV
